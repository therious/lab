/*
  Aside from simple terminal vs non-terminal node visualization distinction
  need a way to provide visualization hints for node to represent the following distinctions

  terminal - no recovery
  terminal - with automated action that restarts system
  ideal state - one state is the target state, it should draw attention

  stepping stone state        - all states leading in target state (if no target state then all states in line from start to terminal states)
  ideal/target state          - one state we are trying to maintain
  recoverable state           - not stepping, terminal, or ideal
  terminal state, no recovery - a state that cannot fix itself
  terminal rebooting state    - a terminal state in terms of machine, but one which restarts same machiune



aside from automatically marking some states as terminal,
need a way to hint to visualizations that some starts indicate an issue, other states are an ideal target state
