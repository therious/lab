# Manifesto

Let's summarize as being "dogmatically undogmatic" to a degree.

* Modest toys some of which toy with some big ideas, among them being
  * create a very small ecosystem for some demoable client and server "toys"
    * housed in a monorepo
    * they get some leverage from some common utilities and components, and some common tech stack choices
    * electron-type shell as optional host for clients and servers
      * subscribe to repo-based channels
      * nearly no distinction between prototypes and actual apps 
* The big ideas
  * 
  * statemachines and statecharts for the masses
  * microservices - (as a design imperative, not not an implementation/boundary choice)
  * event sourcing
