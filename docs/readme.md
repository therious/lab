todos:
remove trains when reverting state (debugging backwards)
disable buttons when appropriate e.g. dealing five cards, dealing cards when empty, getting ticket when empty
implement coast to coast
implement log of who did what

Save discarded color cards to reshuffle deck when out of cards. Suggestion: just have a couple of alternately shuffled decks
waiting behind the original so there is no shortage of cards, and order determined before the game, so it cannot run out.

Middleware to tie effects to actions (before? only after?)

make tickets come out of a vending machine, animation that ends up at layout position for ticket.
That way we eliminate the intro animation on the ticket itself, and put it on a temporary impostor, an Intro, ticket.
